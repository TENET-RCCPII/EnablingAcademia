# EnablingAcademia
This repository will contain training material addressing the need for upskilling of staff in traditional support divisions at public universities in South Africa. The focus would specifically be on creating awareness of the changing landscape of research and teaching and learning in the 21st century. It will provide staff in support divisions an opportunity to learn about the work of other support divisions, to get to know people who work in those other support divisions, and to generally build a community of enablers and overcome the challenge of the traditional silos that still exist in academic support.
